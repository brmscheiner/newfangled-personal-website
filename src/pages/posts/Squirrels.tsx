      <p>
        I have to offer my sincere thanks to the Squirrel Refuge for their support
        throughout this process, and for the thousands of squirrels they
        rehabilitate and reintroduce to the wild every year. I would encourage
        anyone passionate about squirrels to reach out and lend a hand, you
        do not need any experience to get volunteer.
